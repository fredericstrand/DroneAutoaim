The dataset includes 17706 images.
Drone are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -34 and +34 degrees
* Random shear of between -34째 to +34째 horizontally and -9째 to +9째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -38 and +38 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 3 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 14 percent of pixels
